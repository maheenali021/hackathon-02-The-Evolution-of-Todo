## Prompt

```text
You are an expert in creating extremely clear, strict and judge-friendly Spec-Kit constitutions
for AI-driven development hackathons.

Project name: Evolution of Todo – Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development

Core goal of the whole project:
Build a progressively evolving Todo application using 100% spec-driven development with Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus,
without writing any code manually, from simple in-memory CLI → full-stack web app → AI chatbot → cloud-native Kubernetes system

Core philosophical principles (must be strictly followed):
1. Absolute commitment to spec-driven development — no manual code writing allowed
2. Maximum transparency of the development process (we want judges to clearly see iteration & refinement)
3. Progressive complexity — each phase builds meaningfully on the previous one
4. Clean architecture & separation of concerns at every layer
5. Production-grade thinking even in early phases (naming, structure, error handling, security)
6. Strong emphasis on security, user isolation and data ownership (especially after auth is introduced)
7. Stateless services whenever possible (especially Phase III+)
8. Beautiful DX (developer & judge experience) — excellent folder structure, READMEs, clear commit messages

Technology per phase (must be respected):

Phase I     → Python 3.13+, UV, in-memory, console only
Phase II    → Next.js 16+ App Router, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless PostgreSQL, Better Auth + JWT
Phase III   → OpenAI ChatKit (frontend), FastAPI + OpenAI Agents SDK + Official MCP SDK, stateless chat
Phase IV    → Minikube, Docker, Helm charts, Gordon (Docker AI), kubectl-ai / kagent
Phase V     → AKS/GKE/OKE, Dapr (full: pubsub, state, bindings/jobs, secrets, service invocation), Kafka/Redpanda, event-driven architecture

Key standards & constraints:
• Every feature implementation MUST start from a written markdown specification
• All code must be generated by Claude Code (Claude 4 / Claude 3.7 / Claude 4 variants)
• Spec refinement loop is encouraged and valued — show iteration
• No inline TODO comments, commented-out code, or debug prints in final code
• Use modern type hints everywhere (Python + TypeScript)
• Strong naming conventions (RESTful, domain-driven, clear intent)
• Error handling must be thoughtful (HTTP exceptions, graceful messages to user)
• Security: proper user isolation after authentication, never leak other users' data
• Documentation: every phase must have updated README + architecture diagram (mermaid preferred)
• Commit discipline: atomic commits, conventional commit messages preferred

Deliverable quality success criteria (judging perspective):
• Constitution is consistently followed throughout all phases
• Clear trace from specification → generated code
• Beautiful project structure (monorepo with good separation)
• Application works end-to-end in each phase
• Security & user isolation is correctly implemented (very important after Phase II)
• Chatbot in Phase III+ really understands natural language well
```

## Response snapshot

I have successfully updated the constitution file for the "Evolution of Todo – Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development" project. The constitution now includes all the core principles, technology stack per phase, quality standards, and governance rules as specified in the user input.

The updated constitution includes:

1. Core Principles (6 principles covering spec-driven development, progressive complexity, security, etc.)
2. Additional Constraints and Requirements (technology stack per phase, quality and security standards)
3. Development Workflow and Quality Gates (spec-driven process, quality gates)
4. Governance (rules for following the constitution)

The file is now properly configured with version 1.0.0, ratified on 2025-12-29.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution file updated with all project principles and governance rules
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for constitution update
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with comprehensive constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with spec-driven development workflow
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution now provides clear guidance for the hackathon project

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Constitution properly updated
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard constitution update
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin with Phase I implementation following the constitution
