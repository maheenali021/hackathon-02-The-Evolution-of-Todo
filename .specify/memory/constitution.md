# Evolution of Todo – Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Absolute Commitment to Spec-Driven Development
Every feature implementation MUST start from a written markdown specification. All code must be generated by Claude Code without any manual code writing allowed. This ensures maximum transparency of the development process and clear traceability from specification to generated code.

### II. Progressive Complexity and Clean Architecture
Each phase builds meaningfully on the previous one with clean architecture and separation of concerns at every layer. The application must follow the defined technology stack per phase: Phase I (Python 3.13+, UV, in-memory, console only) → Phase II (Next.js 16+ App Router, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless PostgreSQL, Better Auth + JWT) → Phase III (OpenAI ChatKit, FastAPI + OpenAI Agents SDK + Official MCP SDK, stateless chat) → Phase IV (Minikube, Docker, Helm charts, Gordon) → Phase V (AKS/GKE/OKE, Dapr, Kafka/Redpanda).

### III. Production-Grade Thinking and Security
Production-grade thinking must be applied even in early phases with proper naming conventions, structure, error handling, and security. Strong emphasis on security, user isolation and data ownership, especially after authentication is introduced. Proper user isolation after authentication - never leak other users' data.

### IV. Statelessness and Modern Development Standards
Stateless services whenever possible (especially Phase III+). Use modern type hints everywhere (Python + TypeScript). Strong naming conventions (RESTful, domain-driven, clear intent). Error handling must be thoughtful (HTTP exceptions, graceful messages to user).

### V. Beautiful Developer Experience and Documentation
Maximum transparency of the development process for judges to clearly see iteration & refinement. Beautiful DX (developer & judge experience) with excellent folder structure, READMEs, clear commit messages. Documentation: every phase must have updated README + architecture diagram (mermaid preferred). Commit discipline: atomic commits, conventional commit messages preferred.

### VI. Technology and Quality Standards
Use modern type hints everywhere (Python + TypeScript). Strong naming conventions (RESTful, domain-driven, clear intent). Error handling must be thoughtful (HTTP exceptions, graceful messages to user). No inline TODO comments, commented-out code, or debug prints in final code. Spec refinement loop is encouraged and valued — show iteration.

## Additional Constraints and Requirements

### Technology Stack Per Phase
- Phase I: Python 3.13+, UV, in-memory, console only
- Phase II: Next.js 16+ App Router, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless PostgreSQL, Better Auth + JWT
- Phase III: OpenAI ChatKit (frontend), FastAPI + OpenAI Agents SDK + Official MCP SDK, stateless chat
- Phase IV: Minikube, Docker, Helm charts, Gordon (Docker AI), kubectl-ai / kagent
- Phase V: AKS/GKE/OKE, Dapr (full: pubsub, state, bindings/jobs, secrets, service invocation), Kafka/Redpanda, event-driven architecture

### Quality and Security Standards
- Every feature implementation MUST start from a written markdown specification
- All code must be generated by Claude Code (Claude 4 / Claude 3.7 / Claude 4 variants)
- No inline TODO comments, commented-out code, or debug prints in final code
- Security: proper user isolation after authentication, never leak other users' data
- Strong emphasis on security, user isolation and data ownership (especially after auth is introduced)

## Development Workflow and Quality Gates

### Spec-Driven Development Process
1. Every feature starts with a written specification in markdown
2. Specifications must include user scenarios, requirements, and success criteria
3. Code generation must follow from the specification through Claude Code
4. Spec refinement loop is encouraged and valued — show iteration

### Quality Gates
- Code review requirements: All PRs/reviews must verify constitution compliance
- Testing gates: Each user story must be independently testable
- Deployment approval process: Follow conventional commit messages and atomic commits
- Security validation: Verify user isolation and data ownership requirements

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices for the Evolution of Todo project. All development must follow these principles without exception. Amendments to this constitution require explicit documentation, approval, and migration plan. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified and aligned with the progressive phase approach. Use this constitution for runtime development guidance and decision-making.
